If you look at your microcontroller board, you'll notice that there's no easy way to plug

in a monitor, which makes writing the phrase Hello World as a first program actually quite difficult.

When it comes to programming microcontrollers, there is a first program we can write that is quite simple and it tests functionality.

> [!tip]
> 💡 All we have to do is blink an Led.

By doing this, we prove that we can 

1. Compile code 
	compile code with correct syntax
2. Run on platform
	run it on the microcontroller without any errors
3. Control pins
	toggle voltage levels on pins.
# Take a look at your Arduino board

> [!tip]
> 💡 Most of the popular Arduino boards have an onboard Led connected to `PIN 13`.

Once you know it works, you can begin developing on it.

# 1.  Arduino IDE

Open the Arduino program, paste this code below

1. verify ( to compile code)
2. upload (to run and upload code on Arduino board)

## Arduino Programming Language

### Functions
For controlling the Arduino board and performing computations.

**Digital I/O**

📍[pinMode()](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/digital-io/pinMode/)

💬 [digitalWrite()](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/)

**Time**

⏰ [delay()](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/time/delay/)

### Variables
Arduino data types and constants.

**Constants**

🔘 [INPUT | INPUT_PULLUP | OUTPUT](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/variables/constants/inputOutputPullup/)

🔥 [HIGH | LOW](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/variables/constants/highLow/)

### Structure
The elements of Arduino (C++) code.

```

- LED off in 1 second

```

# 3. Experiment

We will learn how to use Pins of Arduino board with LED and a Breadboard to control LED light on/off

use `blink.ino` 

## 1.  Preparation

**Component List**
![[Untitled 2.png]]

| Name | Quantity | Component      |
| ---- | -------- | -------------- |
| U1   | 1        | Arduino Uno R3 |
| B1   | 1        | BreadBoard     |
| D1   | 1        | Red LED        |

## 2.  Build a Circuit

**Blink circuit**
![[Experiment_Blink.png]]

**Schematic**
![[Screenshot_2024-05-02_at_15.32.15.png]]
### Instructions

| Arduino | 220 Ω Resister | LED           |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| PIN 13  | Left / Right   | Anode ( + )   |
| GND     | None           | Cathode ( - ) |
> [!Details]
> 	1. Connect wire from Arduino PIN 13 to the left leg of 220 Ω Resistor and another leg to Anode ( + ) of LED
> 	
> 	2. LED Cathode ( - ) pin to ground (GND of Arduino board) 

## 3.  Coding

`blink.ino`
```cpp
void setup() {
	// put your setup code here, to run once:

  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // PIN 13
  
}

void loop() {
	// put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
	
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s) = 1 second
  
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s) = 1 second
}
```
### Explanation
1. in setup function
```cpp
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // PIN 13
```
	set up to use pin 13 from arduino board

2. in loop function
```cpp
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s) = 1 second
```
	turn on LED for 1 second

```cpp
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
 delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s) = 1 second
```
	turn off LED for 1 second

## 4.  Demonstration  (Check and Testing Your Circuit)
#### What happens
1. The LED turns on for 1 second.
	![[1._Experiment_Blink.png]]
	```C++
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
	delay(1000);
	```
    
2. The LED turns off for 1 second.
	![[1._Experiment_Blink_(1).png]]
	```C++
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
	delay(1000);
	```
    
3. This cycle repeats indefinitely, making the LED blink.
